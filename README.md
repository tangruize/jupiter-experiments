# `jupiter-experiments`

## Model Checking Experiments
We write a script to automatically conduct comprehensive model checking experiments
with the [`jupiter-refinement-project`](https://github.com/hengxin/jupiter-refinement-project).

### Requirements
This has been tested on Linux (with JDK 8), but *not* yet on Windows or Mac.

### Experiments
Now, the script checks two kinds of properties:
1. the refinement relation among a family of Jupiter protocols.
Specifically, it checks that 
- `AJupiter` is a refinement of `XJupiter` (expressed in `AJupiterImplXJupiter`),
- `XJupiter` is a refinement of `CJupiter` (expressed in `XJupierImplCJupiter`), and
- `CJupiter` is a refinement of `AbsJupiter` (expressed in `CJupiterImplAbsJupiter`).
2. the correctness of these Jupiter protocols with respect to the weak list specification (`WLSpec`).
Due to the refinement relation above, it only needs to check that 
- `AbsJupiter` (more precisely, `AbsJupiterH`) satisfies `WLSpec`.

### Parameters
For each of these four properties to check,
we vary the number of client replicas (#Clients) from 1 to 5
and the number of chars (#Chars) allowed to insert from 1 to 5.

For the settings of (#Clients, #Chars) = (3, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 4),
we exit TLC when the number of distinct states TLC examines reaches a given threshold.
For `AbsJupiter`, the threshold is 100, 000, 000,
while for the others, it is 80, 000, 000.

## How to run?

Each of the following command conducts the model checking experiments described above in batch,
and it is allowed to set the number of worker threads.

### Commands
```bash
# Usage Note: In the following three commands, "make" is identical to "make run".
make		# using 10 workers by default (used in our setting)
make WORKERS=2  # using 2 workers
make WORKERS=   # setting the number of workers as that of physical cores in your machine
```

### Output: 
The model checking results are stored in the `mc_result` directory, consisting of 

- A markdown table containing raw (statistic) data.
- Four LaTeX tables which can be used in paper, one for each property to check.

The name of each table file ends with the timestamps it is generated.

A sample model checking result (only the LaTeX tables) is given in `mc_result/cav2019_mc_result`.

### To stop:
- `Ctrl + C`: Stop the individual experiment currently in running
- `Ctrl + \`: Stop the whole batch of experiments

## How is this implemented?

### `tlcwrapper.py`
The `tlcwrapper.py` script encapsulates the usage of TLC commands.

It accepts two parameters:
- The configuration file. The rules are specified in `config.ini`.
- The optional TLC log file (`MC_out.txt` by default).

### `jupiter-cav2019.py`
Run the experiments described above in batch.

It uses `tlcwrapper.py` to start TLC.

### Temp files
TLC generates a subdirectory in the `protocols` directory for each experiment,
which is used to store the `tla` files and `cfg` files required for TLC.

You can use `make clean` to delete them.

Any `MC` files may be helpful for you.

| filename                     | description                                    |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| MC.cfg/MC.tla                | Generated by `TLCWrapper.py`. Required by TLC. |
| MC_out.txt                   | TLC log.                              	        |
| MC_user.txt                  | User output (using `Print` or `PrintT`).       |
| MC_states.dump/MC_states.dot | All states dump (if enabled).                  |
| MC_coverage.txt              | Coverage information (if enabled).             |
